# Getting Started with OpenUSD

Adding SwiftUsd to your project or package

## Getting Started
Before you can start using SwiftUsd, you need to add it as a dependency to your Xcode project or Swift Package, and then configure a few build settings.


> Important: Tested with OpenUSD v25.08, Xcode 26.1.1 (17B100) on macOS 15.6 (24G84), iPadOS 26.0 (23A341), and visionOS 26.1 (23N49).

### Xcode project
1. To use SwiftUsd in an Xcode project, select File > Add Package Dependencies..., and enter the following URL:
```
https://github.com/apple/SwiftUsd
```

2. In the build settings for your target, set `C++ and Objective-C Interoperability` to `C++ / Objective-C++` (`SWIFT_OBJC_INTEROP_MODE=objcxx`). 
3. In the build settings for your target, set `C++ Language Dialect` to `GNU++17 [-std=gnu++17]` (`CLANG_CXX_LANGUAGE_STANDARD=gnu++17`).

> Note:  For command line tools, you may need to set `Runpath Search Paths` to `@executable_path/Frameworks` (`LD_RUNPATH_SEARCH_PATHS=@executable_path/Frameworks`), due to [rdar://138337998: Command line app using Swift Package with binary targets can't find dylibs at runtime](rdar://138337998). 

### Swift Package
1. To use SwiftUsd in a Swift Package, first add it as a dependency:
```swift
dependencies: [
    .package(url: "https://github.com/apple/SwiftUsd", from: "5.2.0"),
]
```

2. Then enable Swift-Cxx interoperability on your Swift targets:
```swift
.target(name: "MyTarget",
        dependencies: [.product(name: "OpenUSD", package: "SwiftUsd")],
        swiftSettings: [
            .interoperabilityMode(.Cxx)
        ]),
```

3. Then set the C++ language standard to GNU++17:
```swift
let package = Package(
    name: "MyPackage",
    targets: [...],
    cxxLanguageStandard: .gnucxx17
)
```

### Using SwiftUsd
Once you've added SwiftUsd as a package depedency to your Xcode project or Swift Package, enabled Swift-Cxx interop, and set the C++ version to GNU++17, you're ready to start using SwiftUsd:
```swift
import OpenUSD

public typealias pxr = pxrInternal_v0_25_8__pxrReserved__

func makeHelloWorldString() -> String {
    let stage = Overlay.Dereference(pxr.UsdStage.CreateInMemory())
    stage.DefinePrim("/hello", .UsdGeomTokens.Xform)
    stage.DefinePrim("/hello/world", .UsdGeomTokens.Sphere)
    return stage.ExportToString() ?? "nil"
}
print(makeHelloWorldString())
```

> Warning: When working in Swift, do not use `TfRefPtr.pointee` or `TfWeakPtr.pointee`, as they are unsafe. Use `Overlay.Dereference(_:TfRefPtr)` and `Overlay.Dereference(_:TfWeakPtr)` instead.

### Common issues 

- Building fails with `Cannot load underlying module for 'CxxStdlib'`  
**Solution**: In the Build Settings for your target, make sure that "C++ and Objective-C Interoperability" is set to "C++ and Objective-C++". (`SWIFT_OBJC_INTEROP_MODE=objcxx` for xcconfig files.)

- Building fails with `Use of undeclared identifier '\_LIBCPP\_ASSERT'` or `Could not build Objective-C module '\_OpenUSD\_SwiftBindingHelpers`  
**Solution**: In the Build Settings for your target, make sure that `C++ Language Dialect` is set to `GNU++17 [-std=gnu++17]`. (`CLANG_CXX_LANGUAGE_STANDARD=gnu++17` for xcconfig files.)

- Building fails with `'<Some Type Here>' is not a member type of enum '__ObjC.pxr'`.  
**Solution**: Add `public typealias pxr = pxrInternal_v0_25_8__pxrReserved__` to one of your Swift files and rebuild. 

- App launches but immediately crashes, and the console says something like `dyld[84216]: Library not loaded: @rpath/Usd_UsdLux.framework/Usd_UsdLux`  
**Solution**: In the Build Settings for your target, make sure that `Runpath Search Paths` is set to `@executable_path/Frameworks`. (`LD_RUNPATH_SEARCH_PATHS=@executable_path/Frameworks` for xcconfig files.)  
Note: This should only affect command line executable targets.
